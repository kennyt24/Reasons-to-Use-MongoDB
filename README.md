# Reasons-to-Use-MongoDB
My Article on MongoDB


According to Statista, MongoDB ranks 5th among the most popular database(DB) management systems worldwide as of August 2022.  

Other top-ranking DBs are Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL. Mongo DB is the only NoSQL database ranking that high from the list. 


MongoDB offers many advantages over traditional relational databases.  With MongoDB Atlas, the cloud offering by MongoDB, you have access to a collection of services that all integrate nicely with your database.

 I love this feature and as a software developer, I use Mongo DB for this reason. 

This feature provides high performance (speed) and makes it easy to accommodate product scalability(growth). It's cost-effective as you will always find a plan that suits your project need and production budget. 

MongoDB supports creating clearer schemas and data validation. This flexibility is an incredible asset when handling real-world data and changes in production requirements or environments.

Hope this helps anyone out there thinking of what database to use for the next project!
